        <p> Nothing says “carefree” quite like a frosty, creamy, chocolate milkshake. Way back in the late 1800s, a milkshake was a whiskey drink thickened with cream and egg yolks. 
            Thankfully the whiskey got replaced with syrup and the thickener became ice cream in the 1920s to make the best drinkable dessert known to humankind. </p>
        <h2> Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> 1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>
            <li> 1 cup cold heavy cream, divided</li>
            <li> 2 tsp granulated sugar</li>
            <li> 1 1/2 cup vanilla ice cream</li>
            <li> 1/4 tsp kosher salt</li>
            <li> chocolate sprinkles</li>
        </ul>
        <h2> Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li> In a small heatproof bowl, microwave chips and 1/4 c. cream on High for 30 seconds. Stir until chips are melted and a glossy sauce forms. </li>
            <li> In a blender on high speed, blend granulated sugar and 1/2 c. cream until whipped cream forms, 1 to 2 minutes. Using a rubber spatula, transfer whipped cream to a small bowl. </li>
            <li>In blender on high speed (no need to wipe out), blend ice cream, salt, remaining 1/4 c. cream, and all but 2 tbsp. chocolate sauce until smooth but still thick, about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Divide milkshake between glasses. Top with whipped cream, reserved chocolate sauce, and sprinkles.   </li>
        </ol>
